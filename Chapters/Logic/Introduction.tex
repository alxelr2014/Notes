\chapter{Introduction}
Mathematical logic is about formalizing mathematic thinking and considers inferences and proofs. The goal in mathematical logic is to construct mathematical models and systems.

It must be noted that mathematical logic is a part of mathematics. In fact it is akin to a Persian grammar book in Persian. It talks about the rules in the language in the same language. In the same way, logic explains various models, mathematically. 

To formalize a thought we need a language. In other words, the materalization of a thought is a set of words in a language. There are two aspects two languages; syntax and semantic. The syntax of a language is the rules and principles of the language. On the other hand, the semantic is about the meaning of words in a language.

Mathematical logic is typically divided into four parts;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set theory.
    \item Model theory.
    \item Proof theory.
    \item Recursion theory.
\end{enumerate}
