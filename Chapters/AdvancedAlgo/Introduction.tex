\chapter{Introduction}
The topics are advanced data structures -- Heap, Splay tree, suffix tree and suffix array-- and advanced algorithms -- string mathcing and network flow. There is also an overview of complexity classes, reducibility, and completeness. Approximation and randomized algorithms are also considered.

\section{Computation Variants}
Computation models include main memory, external memory, and streaming memory. Consider the sequence \(x=x_1x_2\dots x_n\) where each \(x_i \in \calU = \Naturals_m\), count the number of unique elements in \(x\), \(\func{D}{x}\).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item naive approach.
    \item hash approach.
    \item Sample based approach. relative error \(\sqrt{\dfrac{n-r}{2r} \ln \dfrac{1}{\delta}}\). proof is wtf
    \item Streaming model. deterministic memory \(M = \bigOmega{n \log m}\).
    \item Randomized approximation. with a factor of \(1+\epsilon\) and with probability of \(\delta\), the order of some shit is \(\bigO{\log \dfrac{n}{\epsilon^2} \log \dfrac{1}{\delta}}\).
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

-- Distinct sampling.
