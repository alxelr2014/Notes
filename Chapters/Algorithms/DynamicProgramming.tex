\section*{Segmented least squares}
Given a set of points \(P = \set{(x_1,y_1), \dots, (x_n,y_n)}\) with \(x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_n\) and a constant \(C > 0\), find a partition \(\calP = \set{P_1, P_2, \dots, P_k}\) such that each \(P_i\) is a set of consecutive points-- that is, \(P_i = \set{(x_{i_1}, y_{i_1}), (x_{i_1 + 1}, y_{i_1 + 1}) , \dots (x_{i_1 + j}, y_{i_1+j})}\) -- and the sum 
\begin{equation*}
    C \abs{\calP} + \sum_{i =1}^k \func{error}{P_i}
\end{equation*}
is minimized. The error function \(\func{error}{P_i}\) is the error made by the optimal line passing through \(P_i\)-- the least square method.
\section*{Knapsack problem}
\subsection*{Subset problem}
Given a set of items \(\set{(i,w_i)}\) and a constant \(W\), find the maximum sum \(\sum w_i \leq W\).
\subsection*{Knapsack problem}
Given a set of items \(\set{(i,v_i, w_i)}\) and a constant \(W\), find the maximum sum \(\sum v_i\) subject to \(\sum w_i \leq W\).

\subsection*{Negative cycle detection}
\subsection*{Minimum cost path}
\section*{Largest independent set}
Given a tree, find the largest set of vertices that have no edge in common.
\subsection*{Longest common subsequence}
Given two sequences, find the longest common subsequence.
\subsection*{Longest increasing subsequence}
Given a sequence, find the longest increasing subsequence.
\subsection*{Edit distance}
Given two strings \(s,s'\), find the minimum number of operations needed to convert \(s\) to \(s'\). The permitted operations are 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Insert a character
    \item Delete a character
    \item Replace a character
\end{itemize}
