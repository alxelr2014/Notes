The von-Neumann entropy of density matrix \(\rho\) is 
\begin{equation*}
    \func{S}{\rho} = - \func{\trace}{\rho \lg \rho}
\end{equation*}
where \(\lg \rho\) is defined as the matrix \(\begin{bmatrix}
    \lg \rho_D
\end{bmatrix}\)
where \(\rho_D\) is the diagonal matrix representation of \(\rho\).

\begin{proposition}
    The entropy of a pure state is zero.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    When \(\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}\), it can be viewed as a projection onto \(\ket{\psi}\). This projection, with one eigenvalue of \(\lambda = 1\) and rest are zeros. Thus, \(\func{S}{\rho} = - 1 \lg 1 = 0\).
\end{proof}
