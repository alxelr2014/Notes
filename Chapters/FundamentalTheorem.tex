\section{The series of reciprocals of the primes}
\begin{theorem}
    The infinite series \(\sum \frac{1}{p_n}\) diverges.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose it does not, let \(Q = p_1 \dots p_k\). Then, for all \(r \geq 1\), 
    \begin{equation*}
        \sum_{n = 1}^r \dfrac{1}{1 + nQ} \leq \sum_{t =1}^{\infty} \bracket{\sum_{m = k + 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{p_m}}^t
    \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
