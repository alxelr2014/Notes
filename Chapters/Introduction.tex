There four components of economy that we will investigate:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Households
    \item Product market
    \item Labor market
    \item Financial intermediaries
\end{enumerate}

There are two aspects of financial analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item valuating assets
    \item managing assets : Objective + Valuation = Decision
\end{enumerate}

The two factors that make finance interesting are time and risk.
Six principle of finance:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item No free lunches.
    \item Other things equal, individuals:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Want more money than less (non-satiation)
              \item Prefer money now to later (impatience)
              \item Prefer to avoid risk (risk aversion)
          \end{itemize}
    \item All agents act to further their own self-interest
    \item Financial market prices shift to equalize supply and demand
    \item Financial markets are highly adaptive and competitive
    \item Risk-sharing and frictions are central to financial innovation
\end{enumerate}
