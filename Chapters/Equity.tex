\section{Valuation Models}

\begin{align*}
    P_t &= \dfrac{\expected{D_{t+1}}}{1 + r_{t+1}}+ \dfrac{\expected{D_{t+2}}}{(1 + r_{t+2})^2} + \dots \\
    &= \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \dfrac{\expected{D_{t+k}}}{(1 + r_{t+k})^k}
\end{align*}
Where \(P_t\) is the price , \(D_t\) cash divident, \(\expected{\cdot}\) the expectation operator, \(r_t\) risk-adjusted discount rate for cashflow, all at time \(t\).
